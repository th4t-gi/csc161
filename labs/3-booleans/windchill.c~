 * Author: Barbara Z. Johnson and (your names here)
 * Date: June 20, 2022
 * Revised: (today's date)
 * Purpose: to calculate the windchill based on two inputs:
 *		temperature (Fahrenheit) assumed to be an integer
 *      windspeed (miles per hour) assumed to be an integer
 *		forumula:  Twc = F - (W * 0.7)
 *      forumula from  Tom Skilling at the Chicago Tribune
