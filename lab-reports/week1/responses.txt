## Monday ##
A1. see attached liters.c
A2. see attached circle.c

## Wednesday ##
A1.  a=5, b=6, c=0, d=1, e=1, f=1
A2. see expressions.c
A3. Our predictions were correct!

C1. j=2 k=2 l=8
C2. j=4 k=4 l=2
C3. Difference is that the prefix increments first, then returns the value, whereas the postfix returns the value stored in memory then increments it.
  
             \/ increments
 x++ =>  x   ++
         ^ returns value


## Friday ##
A1. printf ("statement 7\n"); isn't in the scope of else block.

A2. We got a different output that prior since we are comparing whether the value of TEST is 7 or not in the second to last if statements and the last if statement would always evaluate to true since it is assigning the value to TEST.

A3. We get the same output as 2nd ques because TEST except 0 would still evaluate as TRUE and -23 doesn't equal 1 for the second to last if statements.

A4. Since the last if statement is assigning the value, it would always results in a true. Therefore, "Statement 13" is always printed in all cases. 

D1. 

F1. true for all integers
F2. its because the expression is left associative and so we are comparing a boolean statement (0 or 1) to 2, which is always less than 2

F3. if (-2 <= x && x <= 2) {
    printf("TRUE!\n");
  } else {
    printf("False\n");
  }
